1.2 Build our first SPA
It’s now time to develop an SPA. We’ll use best practices and explain them as we go.
1.2.1 Define the goal
Our first SPA will have the modest goal of providing a chat slider at the bottom right of the browser window, similar to one you might see on Gmail or Facebook. When we load the application, the slider will be retracted; when we click on the slider, it’ll extend, as shown in figure 1.3. Clicking again will retract it.
